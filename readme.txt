I implemented LeNet neural network architecture to solve traffic sign classfier problem as it has CNN which helps in image learning remarkably.
In the model architecture, convolution layer help in improving the speed and also, to learn specific part of the traffic symbols by each neuron.
Final accuracy on training, validation and test datasets has no drastic change which shows that the model is not over fitted.
Dataset Used : German Traffic Sign Dataset
Accuracy achieved : 93%
